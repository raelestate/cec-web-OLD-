    <p class="text-lg mb-8">
        The Spanish Tradition lives on through Casino Espa√±ol de Cebu.
        It is Cebu's club of choice - a well patronized, financially sustainable world-class landmark:
        - where families, friends and guests relax, meet and consider it their second home;
        - where members, guests and Cebu's elite gather to talk and transact business.
        We are a socially-relevant Club. As we grow as an organization, we help create job opportunities for those who
        are qualified.
